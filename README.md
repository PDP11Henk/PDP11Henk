- 👋 Hi, I’m @PDP11Henk, also a HAM radio amateur with the call-sign PA8PDP.
- 👀 I’m interested in building an F-16 simulator, building and playing with the Motorola 68000 / 68010 / 68020 microprocessors, and collecting PDP-11 hardware from D|I|G|I|T|A|L
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git  :) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on integrating F-16 real instruments with home-made interface hardware to the Benchmark Systems BMS Simulator.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
